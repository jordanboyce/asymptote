"""Request IDs, access logging, and in-flight counters.

Before this, a multi-user incident was undebuggable: agent-loop log lines
carried no way to tie them to a request or a person, and there was no view
of how loaded the process was. This middleware is the floor — an id on
every request (echoed as X-Request-ID so a user can quote it), one access
line per API request with identity and duration, and counters cheap enough
to read on every /api/admin/stats call.

Registered LAST in main.py's file order, which makes it the OUTERMOST
middleware: it times auth and rate limiting too, and by the time the
response comes back through, request.state.auth_identity is set for the
access line. Counters are plain ints guarded by a lock — a histogram
dependency is not worth it for a single-process appliance.

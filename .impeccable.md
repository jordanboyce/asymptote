## Design Context

### Users
Mixed audience — solo researchers, developers exploring their own notes and code, and small teams in regulated environments all share the same surface. They come from different contexts but want the same thing: fast, trustworthy answers grounded in documents they already own. Asymptote is deployed as a web app, a Windows desktop app with tray integration, and in Docker/enterprise configurations, so the UI has to feel at home whether it's opened in a browser tab next to other tools or running as a dedicated desktop companion.

### Job To Be Done
Get answers from your own resources, faster. The product is measured by time-to-answer, not time-on-task. Every interaction should either (a) advance the user toward a specific passage, citation, or synthesized answer, or (b) get out of the way. Secondary jobs — managing collections, tuning OCR, inspecting tokenization — are tools in service of that primary goal and should be discoverable without competing with it.

### Brand Personality
Three words: **Capable. Simple. Intelligent.**

- **Capable** — the product does real work (hybrid retrieval, OCR, multi-format ingest, MCP, enterprise deploy). The UI should telegraph competence without flexing. No performative dashboards.
- **Simple** — surfaces are quiet; affordances earn their place. Reading matters more than chrome. A new user should be able to ignore 80% of the shell and still get an answer.
- **Intelligent** — the product understands the user's intent and meets it with the right tool. The UI respects that by not over-explaining, not repeating itself, and not wrapping every action in tutorial copy.

Emotional target: trust, focus, quiet confidence. The user should feel like they have a capable collaborator, not a product demo.

### Aesthetic Direction
**Reference**: NotebookLM — a study/research companion, not a SaaS dashboard. What to borrow from NotebookLM specifically: the document is the center of attention; source citations are first-class and always reachable; chrome recedes; the product feels like a reading room with tools on the wall rather than an admin console.

**Anti-reference**: generic SaaS admin dashboard. That means no hero metric grids, no card-grid-of-cards, no "welcome back, here's your activity" landing pages, no big rounded stat tiles, no sidebar of gradient nav pills. Also no "cyber AI" aesthetic — neon-on-black with glowing cyan accents is the opposite of a research companion.

**Theme**: DaisyUI's full theme catalog stays enabled — theme choice is a user preference, not a brand statement. The implication is that Asymptote's own design must be *theme-agnostic*: it cannot rely on a specific accent color, contrast story, or dark/light assumption to look good. Everything has to work in `cupcake` and `dracula` alike. This is a meaningful constraint — it means the design language comes from layout, rhythm, typography, and restraint, not from palette.

### Design Principles

1. **The document is the subject; the app is the room.** Chrome, navigation, and controls should recede to let source content, answers, and citations lead. When in doubt, remove a border, not add one.

2. **Earn every pixel.** Before adding a panel, badge, icon, or header, ask whether it moves the user closer to an answer. If not, cut it. Density is fine; ornament is not.

3. **Theme-agnostic by construction.** Use DaisyUI semantic tokens (`base-100/200/300`, `base-content`, `primary`, `accent`, etc.) — never hard-coded colors. Never assume light or dark. Never rely on a specific accent hue for meaning; use shape, weight, position, and iconography instead.

4. **Reading-first typography and rhythm.** This is a product for people who read for a living. Generous line-height in long-form areas (chat, answers, passages), tight and functional in tool surfaces. A clear type hierarchy with real contrast between steps. No monospace-as-personality.

5. **Progressive disclosure over tabs of tabs.** The primary job (ask → answer → cite) should be reachable in one surface. Advanced tools (OCR playground, tokenizer, code indexing, MCP) are real features but live one level down — they should feel discoverable, not ever-present.

6. **Intelligent by silence.** The product shouldn't narrate itself. No redundant headers, no "Welcome to X" banners, no onboarding copy on return visits, no button that says "Click to search" next to a search box. Fewer words, more signal.

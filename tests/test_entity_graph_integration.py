"""Integration: entity-graph boost moves chunks across the results boundary.

Builds a tiny three-document corpus in a throwaway collection where:
  - doc_a (Alice) and doc_b (Bob) never mention each other — the vector
    scores here are artificial so we control them exactly;
  - doc_c names Alice AND Project Titan — it's the cross-document bridge.

With plain semantic search (mocked embeddings) doc_c does not crack top-2 for
"who worked with Alice on Project Titan?" With the entity boost on, it must.

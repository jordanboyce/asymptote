# Identity: who a request is

Asymptote has two separate questions, and they are often confused:

- **Can this caller in at all?** `AUTH_PASSWORD`, or nothing on a closed
  network. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).
- **Who is this caller?** `IDENTITY_PROVIDER`. This page.

The second one only matters when something acts on it. Two things do:
`PRIVATE_COLLECTIONS` (per-person ownership and sharing) and the audit trail
(`actor` on every recorded event). Without a verified identity the app is a
shared appliance: everyone who gets in sees the whole corpus, which is the
right model for a team and the wrong one for an agency.

The app **refuses to start** on an identity configuration it cannot enforce.
That is deliberate: a boundary that is advertised but not enforced is worse
than no boundary, because people put things behind it.

## Pick a provider

| `IDENTITY_PROVIDER` | Use when | Identity comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *(empty)* | Team appliance, or you already set `CF_ACCESS_*` | Auto: Cloudflare if configured, else nobody |
| `cloudflare_access` | Internet-facing, via Cloudflare Tunnel | `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` |
| `oidc` | **On-prem / air-gapped.** You run Keycloak, Entra ID, Okta, PingFederate, ADFS | `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` |
| `trusted_header` | An authenticating proxy already fronts the app (mTLS, SPNEGO/Kerberos, a site SSO proxy) | A header that proxy sets |

Leaving `IDENTITY_PROVIDER` empty keeps every existing Cloudflare deployment
working unchanged — `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` + `CF_ACCESS_AUD` still select
Cloudflare on their own.

---

## `oidc` — your own identity provider

The on-prem answer. Tokens your IdP already issues become identities here.

```bash
IDENTITY_PROVIDER=oidc
OIDC_ISSUER=https://sso.agency.gov/realms/main
OIDC_AUDIENCE=asymptote               # the client id / API audience
OIDC_IDENTITY_CLAIM=email             # default; preferred_username and sub are fallbacks
PRIVATE_COLLECTIONS=true
```

**`OIDC_AUDIENCE` is not optional.** Without it, any token your IdP ever
issued — for any application in the realm — would be accepted here. The app
refuses to start without it.

What is verified on every request: the signature against the issuer's JWKS,
the issuer, the audience, and the expiry. Asymmetric algorithms only
(`RS*`/`ES*`/`PS*`) — an `HS256` token is refused even when it names a known
key id, because otherwise the published JWKS modulus becomes a signing key
anyone can use.

### Narrowing admission by claim

```bash
OIDC_REQUIRED_CLAIMS=groups=asymptote-users
```

Comma-separated `name=value` pairs, all required. Each matches a scalar
claim or membership in a list claim, so one IdP group can gate the whole
deployment. Have your IdP release that claim to this client.

### Air-gapped: skip discovery

By default the issuer's `/.well-known/openid-configuration` is fetched to
find the JWKS URL. If that is unreachable, name the key set directly:

```bash
OIDC_JWKS_URL=https://sso.internal/realms/main/protocol/openid-connect/certs
```

Keys are cached for an hour and refreshed once on an unknown key id, so IdP
key rotation needs no restart. If the JWKS cannot be fetched at all, requests
are **refused**, never admitted.

### Certificates

An internal IdP usually presents a private CA certificate. Mount the CA at
`/certs/ca` — the container installs it into both the system store and
certifi's bundle at start up. See [ONPREM.md](ONPREM.md).

### What the agent clients do

Two ways in, both ending as the same person:

- **Personal MCP tokens** (Settings → MCP) for clients that take a static
  bearer header — Codex, VS Code, AnythingLLM, Claude Code with a pasted
  token. Minted by someone already signed in; carries their identity.
- **OAuth sign-in** for connector-style clients — Claude Desktop, claude.ai,
  ChatGPT, and `claude mcp login`. The client sends the person to this IdP
  and presents the token it gets; nothing to paste. Set `MCP_PUBLIC_URL`
  and see [OAuth for MCP clients](#oauth-for-mcp-clients) below.

---

## `trusted_header` — an authenticating proxy

For sites whose front door is already a proxy that authenticates: an mTLS
terminator passing the certificate subject, a Kerberos/SPNEGO front end, or
an existing SSO proxy.

```bash
IDENTITY_PROVIDER=trusted_header
TRUSTED_HEADER_NAME=X-Forwarded-User
HOST=127.0.0.1                 # the guard: your proxy is the only route in
PRIVATE_COLLECTIONS=true
```

The header is forgeable by anything that can open a socket to the app, so
one of two guards is **mandatory** — the app will not start otherwise:

1. **`HOST` is loopback.** Only a process on the host can connect, so the
   proxy is the only route in. Simplest, and correct for the usual
   nginx/Apache-in-front shape.
2. **`TRUSTED_HEADER_SECRET`.** The proxy proves the identity with
   HMAC-SHA256 over the header value, hex-encoded, in
   `TRUSTED_HEADER_SIGNATURE_NAME`. Holds regardless of network path — use
   it when the proxy is on another host.

```bash
TRUSTED_HEADER_SECRET=<32+ random bytes>
TRUSTED_HEADER_SIGNATURE_NAME=X-Forwarded-User-Signature
```

The signature covers the identity value exactly:

```
signature = hex( HMAC-SHA256( TRUSTED_HEADER_SECRET, "analyst@agency.gov" ) )
```

Signing the value — not just sending a shared secret — is what stops a proxy
bug, or anything that learns the secret from a log, from claiming to be
someone else.

### Why `TRUSTED_HEADER_PROXIES` is not a guard by itself

```bash
TRUSTED_HEADER_PROXIES=10.8.0.0/24    # defence in depth, never the only guard
```

uvicorn's proxy-header handling rewrites the peer address from
`X-Forwarded-For` for connections from `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` (127.0.0.1 by
default). So the address this check sees is not always the real socket peer,
and a check the caller can influence is not a boundary. The app enforces
this: a configuration whose only guard is a CIDR list refuses to start.

### mTLS

Terminate TLS at the proxy, then pass the subject:

```nginx
# nginx
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-User $ssl_client_s_dn_cn;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-User-Signature $hmac;   # njs/Lua, if not loopback
```

Make sure the proxy **strips any inbound `X-Forwarded-User`** before setting
its own. `proxy_set_header` replaces rather than appends, which covers the
usual case.

## OAuth for MCP clients

Connector-style MCP clients — Claude Desktop, claude.ai, ChatGPT, and
Claude Code when you run `claude mcp login` instead of pasting a token —
follow the MCP authorization spec: they treat `/mcp` as an OAuth 2.1
*resource server*, discover its *authorization server* from RFC 9728
metadata, send the person through a browser sign-in there, and present the
bearer token they get back.

Asymptote implements exactly the resource-server half. **The authorization
server is your IdP.** There is deliberately no embedded one: an agency
already runs an IdP, an embedded authorization server would be a second
copy of every identity, and it is precisely the component a security review
rejects.

### With `oidc`: one more setting

`IDENTITY_PROVIDER=oidc` already names the issuer and audience. Add the URL
clients reach the endpoint at:

```bash
MCP_PUBLIC_URL=https://asymptote.agency.gov/mcp
```

That is the RFC 9728 `resource`. Clients always ask the IdP for a token
*for that resource* (RFC 8707), and an IdP that honours the request mints a
token whose audience is that URL — which is accepted, alongside
`OIDC_AUDIENCE`, for IdPs that ignore the resource parameter (Entra ID
among them). Left empty, the URL is derived from `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and
failing that from each request's `Host` header; a derived value is only
ever advertised, never accepted as an audience.

What happens when a client connects:

1. `POST /mcp` with no token → `401` with
   `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="https://…/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp"`
   (plus `scope="…"` if one is required).
2. The client reads that document: `authorization_servers: ["<OIDC_ISSUER>"]`.
   Both `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and the `/mcp`-suffixed form
   are served, unauthenticated, and answer 404 when no authorization server
   applies.
3. The client fetches the IdP's own metadata
   (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` or
   `/.well-known/openid-configuration`), obtains a client id (next section),
   and runs the PKCE authorization-code flow in the browser.
4. It presents the token on every request. The token is verified by the
   **same code path as a browser session** — signature against the JWKS,
   issuer, audience, `exp`, `OIDC_REQUIRED_CLAIMS`, asymmetric algorithms
   only — so the caller *is* that person: private collections scope to
   them, the audit trail names them, and `ADMIN_EMAILS` applies.

### Client registration is the IdP's job

The metadata names no registration endpoint on purpose. The current MCP
spec (2026-07-28) deprecates dynamic client registration and tells clients
to prefer, in order: a pre-registered client id, a Client ID Metadata
Document (the client identifies itself by an HTTPS URL the IdP fetches),
then dynamic registration. Every client that matters accepts a
pre-registered id, so nothing here depends on the IdP supporting more.

| IdP | Zero-touch path | Otherwise |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keycloak | Anonymous dynamic registration is built in (`registration_endpoint` is advertised). Allow the client's host in the realm's *Client registration → Anonymous access policies → Trusted Hosts*, or hand out an initial access token. | Create a public client with the client's redirect URI; give people its client id. |
| Okta, Auth0 | Dynamic registration where enabled on the tenant; both are adding Client ID Metadata Document support. | An *Application* of type native/SPA (public, PKCE) with the client's redirect URI. |
| Entra ID | None — no dynamic registration. | An *App registration* (public client, PKCE) with the client's redirect URI; set `OIDC_AUDIENCE` to its Application ID URI or client id, since Entra ignores `resource`. |

Where the client id goes: Claude Desktop / claude.ai — *Add custom
connector → Advanced settings*; ChatGPT — the OAuth client fields of the
connector; Claude Code — `claude mcp add --transport http --client-id <id>
[--callback-port <port>] asymptote https://…/mcp`. Redirect URIs the clients
use (confirm in the client's docs, they change): Claude Code
`http://localhost:<port>/callback` (random port unless `--callback-port`),
claude.ai / Claude Desktop `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback`,
ChatGPT `https://chatgpt.com/connector_platform_oauth_redirect`. The hosted
clients connect from Anthropic's and OpenAI's servers, so both the endpoint
and the IdP must be reachable from the internet for them.

### Requiring a scope

```bash
MCP_OAUTH_SCOPE=asymptote-mcp
```

Then a token must carry that scope (`scope` or `scp` claim, string or
list) to be accepted on `/mcp`, while the same token stays a fine browser
session. It is advertised as `scopes_supported` and in the 401 challenge,
so clients request it; a token that is valid for the app but lacks it gets
`403` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_scope", scope="…"`,
which is the step-up signal the spec defines. Define the scope at the IdP
(a Keycloak client scope, an Entra *Expose an API* scope). Leave it empty
unless you want MCP access to be a separately granted permission.

One consequence worth knowing before you turn it on: a client that
registers itself dynamically asks the IdP for exactly the scope in the
challenge, and Keycloak then gives that client *only* that scope. The
token it mints carries no audience and no email unless the scope itself
provides them, and the app refuses it — correctly. So on Keycloak, put the
audience mapper and the identity-claim mapper on the MCP client scope, not
only on the realm defaults; `scripts/oauth_smoke/keycloak_realm.py` shows
the shape. Pre-registered clients are configured by hand and do not have
this problem.

### A different IdP for `/mcp` only

A Cloudflare Access deployment's browser identity is the Access assertion,
not a bearer JWT, so it has no authorization server to advertise. Name one
for `/mcp` only:

```bash
MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER=https://sso.agency.gov/realms/main    # or Access for SaaS (OIDC)
MCP_OAUTH_AUDIENCE=asymptote-mcp
MCP_OAUTH_JWKS_URL=                                    # optional, skips discovery
MCP_PUBLIC_URL=https://asymptote.agency.gov/mcp
```

Tokens from that issuer are accepted on `/mcp` and nowhere else, and the
Access-verified identity keeps working on `/mcp` beside them (a service
token, for instance). The edge must let `/mcp` and
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` through to the app —
`scripts/provision_cloudflare.py` adds both bypasses. Use the identity
claim that matches what Access reports (email), so a person is the same
person on both paths.

### What is refused

Wrong audience, wrong issuer, expired, no `exp`, a signature the JWKS does
not verify, `HS256` even with a known key id, a token for another
resource, a token without the required scope (403, above). At startup:
`MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER` without `MCP_OAUTH_AUDIENCE`, a plaintext issuer,
`MCP_OAUTH_SCOPE` with no authorization server to enforce it, and an
`MCP_PUBLIC_URL` that is not an absolute http(s) URL.

### Checking it

```bash
curl -si -X POST https://asymptote.agency.gov/mcp | grep -i www-authenticate
curl -s https://asymptote.agency.gov/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp
claude mcp add --transport http asymptote https://asymptote.agency.gov/mcp
claude mcp login asymptote          # opens the browser at your IdP
```

Settings → MCP shows the same URL and per-client steps whenever an
authorization server applies. For a full rehearsal against a throwaway
Keycloak — dynamic registration, a pre-registered client, the SDK's
reference client, the scope step-up — see
[scripts/oauth_smoke/README.md](../scripts/oauth_smoke/README.md).

## Auditing what agents read

Writes have always been audited. Reads over MCP are not, unless you ask:

```bash
MCP_AUDIT_TOOL_CALLS=true
```

Then every MCP tool call appends an `mcp.tool_call` event: the tool, the
verified identity, the personal token id, the collection, the documents
touched and how many results came back. Export it from Admin → Audit.

Deliberately **not** recorded: passage text, queries, and result contents.
The audit table is read by more people and kept longer than the corpus it
describes, so it must not become a second copy of it.

Retention follows `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` (0 = forever). Expect roughly one
row per tool call — an agent turn is typically several.

## Checklist

- [ ] `IDENTITY_PROVIDER` set (or `CF_ACCESS_*` for the Cloudflare default)
- [ ] The app starts — a refusal here names exactly what is missing
- [ ] `OIDC_AUDIENCE` is this app's client id, not a shared or wildcard value
- [ ] `PRIVATE_COLLECTIONS=true` if people should not see each other's sources
- [ ] For `trusted_header`: loopback bind or HMAC secret, and the proxy
      strips inbound copies of the identity header
- [ ] `MCP_AUDIT_TOOL_CALLS=true` where reads must be accountable
- [ ] `ADMIN_EMAILS` lists identities as this provider reports them (the
      email claim, the certificate CN — whatever `OIDC_IDENTITY_CLAIM` or the
      proxy header actually contains)

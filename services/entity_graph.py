"""Entity-graph retrieval augmentation.

A lightweight substitute for full GraphRAG: no LLM extraction pass, no graph
database. Entities are noun-phrase-ish spans found heuristically in each chunk
at index time (proper nouns, acronyms, Capitalized Phrases) and stored in the
collection's SQLite database — the same file that already holds chunk
metadata. At query time, chunks that mention the same entities as the query
are surfaced from across documents and blended into the semantic/hybrid
ranking in ``indexer.search``.

This is what answers cross-document questions ("who worked with X on Y?")
that pure vector similarity misses: the decisive chunk rarely resembles the
question, it just names the same two entities.

The extractor is deliberately conservative — precision over recall. A garbage
entity only adds noise; a missed one just means the query falls back to plain
vector/BM25 behavior, which is today's status quo.

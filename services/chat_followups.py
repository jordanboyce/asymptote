"""Suggested questions around an answer: related follow-ups and collection starters.

Both are one cheap call on the provider's fast model, made after the answer
itself is settled, and both are best-effort: any provider or parsing failure
yields an empty list, never a failed turn. Source text is data, not
instructions, so the prompts say so and the output is parsed defensively.

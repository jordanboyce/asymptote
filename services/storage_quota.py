"""Per-collection storage cap.

Every collection may hold at most ``COLLECTION_STORAGE_LIMIT_BYTES`` of
source material (5 GiB by default), measured as the sum of ``file_size``
over its ``documents`` rows — the bytes of every upload, staged copy,
in-place reference and agent-written source the collection has indexed.

Why bytes of source and not bytes of index: the number a person can reason
about is "how much have I put in", and it is the same figure whether the
collection lives on SQLite or Postgres, whether OCR ran, or which embedding
model was chosen. Index size is an operator concern reported elsewhere.

Enforcement is at the ingest entry points (``api/documents.py``, the bulk
job in ``services/upload_service.py`` and ``write_document`` over MCP),
not inside the indexer: by the time the indexer sees a file its bytes are
already on disk, and refusing early means a rejected upload never waits
in the embedding queue. Bulk jobs prepare files on several threads and
commit them in batches, so a plain "usage + this file" check would let a
whole batch slip past the cap at once; the in-process reservation ledger
below counts bytes that are accepted but not yet committed. One process,
one ledger (see docs/DEPLOYMENT.md on the single-process model).

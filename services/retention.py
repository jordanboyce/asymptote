"""Periodic retention for the two unbounded log tables.

search_history stores full result snippets — document text — so keeping it
forever is a privacy liability, not a feature; before this task existed it
was written on every search and never deleted (or read). chat_usage is
small per row but grows with every turn.

One asyncio task, started from main.py's lifespan: first sweep 60 s after
boot (not during startup, which is already busy loading models), then every
24 h. Deletes are cheap timestamp-indexed range scans on both backends.

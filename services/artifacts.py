"""Generated artifacts: turn a collection into a cited document.

The reference product's highest-value surface isn't Q&A — it's *generated
outputs* from your sources (a summary, an FAQ, a study guide, a timeline, a
briefing). This module owns the prompt templates that drive those generations.

It is a thin adapter: each artifact type maps to an instruction message that is
fed through the existing provider-agnostic chat tool loop (the same loop the
in-app chat uses), so grounding, citations, the structured-table tools, and the
sources list all come for free. We add no new retrieval or synthesis engine —
only the framing. See `/api/artifacts` in main.py for the orchestration.

# Appended to every artifact instruction so generations stay grounded and
# citable regardless of type. The chat loop already returns a structured
# `sources` list; this keeps inline attribution consistent too.
